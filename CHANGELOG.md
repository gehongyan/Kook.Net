## v0.9.0 [2024-08-30]

### Update Roadmap

This update introduces the following new packages:

- `Kook.Net.Webhook`: Webhook support package
- `Kook.Net.Webhook.HttpListener`: Webhook implementation package for HTTP Listener
- `Kook.Net.Webhook.AspNet`: Webhook implementation package integrated with ASP.NET
- `Kook.Net.MessageQueue.InMemory`: In-memory message queue support package
- `Kook.Net.MessageQueue.MassTransit`: MassTransit message queue support package
- `Kook.Net.DependencyInjection.Microsoft`: Dependency injection extension package for
  Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- `Kook.Net.Hosting`: Hosting service extension package

The `Kook.Net` package now references the `Kook.Net.Webhook` package and has removed the reference to the
`Kook.Net.CardMarkup` package. If you need to continue using the functionality for building card messages via markup
language, please reference the `Kook.Net.CardMarkup` package separately.

Voice connection and streaming features have been changed to be implemented by an officially supported method. The newly
added API for receiving voice data streams is experimental and not officially supported.

The exception thrown by `Emote.Parse` when an error occurs has been changed from `ArgumentException` to
`FormatException`. The return result of `Emote.ToString` has been changed to be equivalent to the result of
`ToKMarkdownString`. The link format provided by `MessageExtensions.GetJumpUrl` has been adjusted.
`SocketGuild.ValidBoostSubscriptions` has been changed to `SocketGuild.ActiveBoostSubscriptions`. `Tag<T>` has been
changed to `Tag<TKey, TValue>`.

### Added

- Added support for custom message queues, with the default implementation being synchronous message processing. Support
  for setting the message queue provider by installing extension NuGet packages and configuring
  `KookSocketConfig.MessageQueueProvider`. `Kook.Net.MessageQueue.InMemory` is the in-memory queue support package, and
  `Kook.Net.MessageQueue.MassTransit` is the MassTransit queue support package. Refer to the examples for usage.
- Added support for Webhook mode, which is currently implemented based on the Socket implementation. The Webhook
  integrated by Kook.Net is the abstract class `KookWebhookClient`. `Kook.Net.Webhook.HttpListener` is the Webhook
  implementation package for HTTP Listener, and `Kook.Net.Webhook.AspNet` is the Webhook implementation package
  integrated with ASP.NET. Refer to the examples for usage.
- Added extension methods package for the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection dependency injection framework
  `Kook.Net.DependencyInjection.Microsoft`, to support quick addition of various clients from Kook.Net, refer to the
  examples for usage.
- Added hosting service extension package based on `IHost` and `IHostedService` `Kook.Net.Hosting`, to support quick
  addition of various clients from Kook.Net as hosting services, refer to the examples for usage.
- Added support for receiving voice data stream related APIs. (Experimental feature, not officially supported)
- The text command framework has added built-in support for parameter parsing of `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly` types, added
  support for parameter parsing of `Uri` type, and added command parsing for mixed text-image messages.
- Added extension method `MaybeTextImageMixedMessage` on `IUserMessage` to determine if it might be a mixed text-image
  message.
- Made the constructor of `Emote` public.
- Added `KookComparers` class to support KOOK entities comparison by ID.
- Added `Parse` and `TryParse` methods to the `Color` class.
- `IKookClient` provides `LoginAsync` and `LogoutAsync` methods.

- Fixed the issue where the implementation on `IGuild` did not expose the `IsAvailable` property.
- Fixed the issue where the values of `EveryoneMention` and `HereMention` in `ITag` might be `0` instead of `0U`.

### Changed

- After user code manipulates server member roles via API, the framework will attempt to update the cache to get as
  accurate role information as possible without updating user role information via API.
- The exception thrown by `Emote.Parse` when an error occurs has been changed from `ArgumentException` to
  `FormatException`.
- The return result of `Emote.ToString` has been changed to be equivalent to the result of `ToKMarkdownString`.

## v0.8.0 [2024-05-28]

### Update Roadmap

Due to changes in the KOOK API, Bot users can no longer obtain all the necessary basic guild information at startup
through the `/guild/index` API. Instead, it is now required to traverse each guild via the `/guild/view`
API. This change can result in a significantly longer startup time and a large number of API requests for Bots
that have joined many guilds. Therefore, the current version introduces the `KookSocketConfig.StartupCacheFetchMode`
configuration item, which defines how the Bot loads the basic guild data needed at startup.

- `Synchronous`: In synchronous mode, after obtaining a simple list of guilds at client startup, the client fetches the
  basic data of each guild through the API before triggering the `Ready` event.
- `Asynchronous`: In asynchronous mode, after obtaining a simple list of guilds at client startup, the `Ready` event is
  triggered immediately, and a background task is started to fetch all the basic guild data.
- `Lazy`: In lazy mode, after obtaining a simple list of guilds at client startup, the `Ready` event is triggered
  immediately without proactively fetching the basic guild data. When events involving the guild are received from the
  gateway, the guild's basic data will be fetched through the API if it has not already been obtained.
- `Auto`: In automatic mode, the default setting, the client's startup mode is automatically determined based on the
  number of guilds the Bot has joined. If the number of guilds reaches `LargeNumberOfGuildsThreshold` (default is 50),
  it will be `Lazy`; if it reaches `SmallNumberOfGuildsThreshold` (default is 5), it will be `Asynchronous`; otherwise,
  it will be `Synchronous`. This determination is made each time the Bot connects to the WebSocket.

When not using `Synchronous` mode, after the `Ready` event, accessing cached guild entities might result in entities
that do not fully contain basic guild data. The `IsAvailable` property indicates whether the guild entity has fully
cached basic data through the API. In such cases, please proactively call the `UpdateAsync` method to update the cached
guild entity through the API. The basic guild data mentioned above mainly includes the guild's channels, roles,
channel permission overrides, and the current user's nickname within guilds.

The entire framework code has been updated to support nullable reference static analysis diagnostics. For the concept of
nullable reference types in C#, please refer to [Nullable reference types - C# | Microsoft Learn]. After updating to the
current version, all values that may be null will be marked as nullable types. This may cause some code to generate
warnings during compilation, which should be treated as potential null reference exceptions and fixed accordingly.

Additionally, `IQuote` has a new implementation `MessageReference`, which only contains the ID of the message to be
referenced and is used when calling the API in user code. Existing user code that creates `Quote` should migrate
to `MessageReference` as soon as possible.

`fileName` has been renamed to `filename`; the event parameter `Cacheable<SocketMessage, Guid>` has been changed
to `Cacheable<IMessage, Guid>`; `SectionAccessoryMode.Unspecified` is now replaced by `null`; `Format.StripMarkDown` has
been renamed to `StripMarkdown`; and the `filename` parameter in the `SendFileAsync` overload that accepts the `Stream`
type is now mandatory. Please note that these changes may cause compilation errors and should be fixed accordingly.

### Additions

- `KookSocketConfig` adds the `StartupCacheFetchMode`, `LargeNumberOfGuildsThreshold`,
  and `SmallNumberOfGuildsThreshold` configuration items to customize how the Bot's Socket client fetches the basic
  guild data needed at startup via the API.
- Two new configuration properties `AutoUpdateRolePositions` and `AutoUpdateChannelPositions` have been added
  to `KookSocketConfig`, defaulting to `false`. When enabled, the client will automatically fetch data via the API upon
  receiving related events to maintain the cached role and channel sorting information.
- `Embed` adds `CardEmbed`.
- Card entities and builders now implement `IEquatable<T>`.
- `SocketSelfUser` now implements `IUpdateable`.
- Added `IGuild.RecommendInfo.Certifications`.
- `IQuote` has a new implementation `MessageReference`, which only contains the ID of the message to be referenced and
  is used when calling the API in user code.
- Support for the event types `embeds_append`, `sort_channel`, `updated_server_type`, `batch_added_channel`,
  `batch_updated_channel`, `batch_deleted_channel`, `live_status_changed`, `PERSON` typed `updated_guild`,
  `add_guild_mute`, `delete_guild_mute`, `unread_count_changed` has been added, but it is not yet confirmed
  whether these events will actually be dispatched.

### Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the author of private messages was incorrect.
- Fixed the issue where `SocketUserMessage.Quote.Author` could be null.
- Fixed the issue where Tags were missing corresponding values when referencing nonexistent entities in messages.
- Fixed the issue where the voice client failed to handle undefined events, causing stream crashes.
- Fixed the issue where parsing newly introduced mixed media messages failed.
- Corrected the behavior of updating user nicknames.

### Changes

- Enabled nullable reference types feature. For the concept of nullable reference types in C#, please refer
  to [Nullable reference types - C# | Microsoft Learn].
- Various validations for the card builder are now deferred to the `Build` call.
- The types of properties involving lists in cards have been changed to `IList<T>`.
- `Quote.Empty` and its public constructor have been marked as `Obsolete`, and `MessageReference` should be used
  instead.
- `fileName` has been renamed to `filename`.
- The `filename` parameter in the `SendFileAsync` overload that accepts the `Stream` type is now mandatory.
- `BaseSocketClient._baseConfig` has been renamed to `BaseConfig`.
- The event parameter `Cacheable<SocketMessage, Guid>` has been changed to `Cacheable<IMessage, Guid>` to address the
  issue of entity download failure.
- `SectionAccessoryMode.Unspecified` has been removed; please use `null` instead.
- `Format.StripMarkDown` has been renamed to `StripMarkdown`, and the original method has been marked as `Obsolete`.
- `Format.StripMarkdown` now removes hyphens `-`.

### Others

- Added a reference to `PolySharp` on .NET 7 and earlier target frameworks to support the implementation of some new
  features on older frameworks.
- Added integration tests for some Socket events.

## v0.7.0 [2024-04-02]

### Update Roadmap

The KOOK client now supports sending messages within voice channels. As a result, the following APIs have been modified:

- `CreateVoiceChannelProperties` now inherits from `CreateTextChannelProperties`.
- `ModifyVoiceChannelProperties` now inherits from `ModifyTextChannelProperties`.
- `IVoiceChannel` now inherits from `ITextChannel`.
- The value of `ChannelPermissions.Voice` now includes permissions for text channels.
- The `SocketTextChannel.GetMessagesAsync` series of methods are now virtual methods, to be overridden
  by `SocketVoiceChannel`.

It's important to note that, due to limitations in the KOOK API, fetching message history and pinning messages are not
supported within voice channels. Therefore, calling `GetMessagesAsync` and `GetPinnedMessagesAsync` methods from
`IMessageChannel` on voice channels is not supported.

Additionally, while voice channels support operations on `Topic` and `SlowModeInterval` at the API level, the KOOK
client
currently does not reflect these capabilities.

Creating channels does not immediately support specifying a Topic. The `Topic` property in `CreateTextChannelProperties`
has been removed and does not take effect. Please use the `ITextChannel.ModifyAsync` method to modify the channel after
creation.

### Added

- Added support for defining card messages via XML.
- `IVoiceChannel` now inherits from `ITextChannel`, with relevant implementations updated.
- Added `SentRequest` event to `BaseKookClient`.
- Added non-null result prompts for parsing card message-related `Try*` methods.

### Fixed

- Corrected the issue with `ConnectionManager` incorrectly updating `State` when `Disconnected`.

### Changes

- Removed the `Topic` property from `CreateTextChannelProperties`.

### Misc

- Marked the project as not supporting AOT and assembly trimming.
- Added example project `Kook.Net.Samples.CardMarkup`.
- Added documentation for defining card messages via XML.
- Added Logo.

## v0.6.0 [2024-02-28]

## v0.5.0 [2023-05-21]

### Update Path

For the sake of convenience, this version has made adjustments to the parameter types passed in some events
in `BaseSocketClient`. Please refer to the appendix at the end of the document for specific changes to event parameters.
Applications involving these events need to be updated accordingly.

The enum values and properties representing key accounts in `GuildFeature` and `GuildFeatures` have been renamed
for more accurate naming. `GuildPermissions` has been refactored as a struct, and the type of
the `RoleProperties.Permissions` property has been changed accordingly. The type of `RestGuild.Channels` was incorrectly
declared as a dictionary with values of type `RestChannel`, and has been corrected to a dictionary with values of
type `RestGuildChannel`. The return type of some methods on `KookSocketClient` was previously `ValueTask`, but has now
been unified to `Task`. Usages involving these APIs need to be updated accordingly.

- Changed `GuildPermissions` to a struct and changed `RoleProperties.Permissions` to type `GuildPermissions?`.
- For convenience, some events in `BaseSocketClient` have been changed or added with event parameters. See the appendix
  at the end of the document for details..
- Changed all parameters of `DownloadBoostSubscriptionsAsync` method on `BaseSocketClient` to optional parameters.
- Changed the type of `RestGuild.Channels` to `ImmutableDictionary<ulong, RestGuildChannel>`.
- Changed the return type of `GetChannelAsync`, `GetDMChannelAsync`, `GetDMChannelsAsync`, and `GetUserAsync` methods
  on `KookSocketClient` to `Task<*>`.

### Fixed

- `FileAttachment.Stream` can now be reused.
- The `SendFileAsync` and `ReplyFileAsync` methods will now cache the asset URI created for `FileAttachment` attachments
  created through files or streams before multiple sends, to avoid uploading the same file repeatedly.

### Misc

- Fixed some strange code indentation.
- Changed the document theme.
- Added a separate workflow for updating the documentation that depends on the `doc` branch.

- `DirectReactionAdded` and `DirectReactionRemoved`
    - Add `Cacheable<SocketUser, ulong>` representing the user who added or removed the reaction

- `MessageReceived`
    - Add `SocketGuildUser` representing the user who sent the message
    - Add `SocketTextChannel` representing the text channel where the message was sent

- `MessageDeleted`、`MessageUpdated`、`MessagePinned` 与 `MessageUnpinned`
    - `ISocketMessageChannel` → `SocketTextChannel`

- `DirectMessageReceived`
    - Add `SocketUser` representing the user who sent the message
    - Add `SocketDMChannel`representing the DM channel where the message was sent

## v0.4.1 [2023-04-05]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the corresponding permission overwrites of `SocketGuildChannel.UserPermissionOverwrites` and
  `SocketGuildChannel.RolePermissionOverwrites` were not removed when a user left the guild or a role was deleted.

## v0.4.0 [2023-04-03]

### Update Path

Due to the following reasons, this version has made adjustments to the parameter types passed in some events
in `BaseSocketClient`:

- Some parameters are always present and do not need to be wrapped with `Cacheable`, such as `MessageDeleted`
  and `UserConnected`.
- The data sent by the gateway is incomplete, resulting in missing parameters in some events. These event parameters
  have been adjusted to entities wrapped with `Cacheable` to fix the issue of unknown entity IDs that cannot be obtained
  through the REST client API request for complete data.
- The original processing logic for incomplete data sent by the gateway was to obtain complete data by initiating API
  requests through the REST client, which may cause performance issues or timeouts in large servers, such
  as `GuildMemberOnline` and `GuildMemberOffline`. These event parameters have been adjusted to entities wrapped
  with `Cacheable`, and can be obtained on demand through the `GetOrDownloadAsync` method.
- Some event parameters are too specific, resulting in a mismatch of types and passing empty values, such
  as `ReactionAdded`.
- Some event parameters are too general, such as `MessageDeleted` and `UserConnected`, which can avoid unnecessary
  pattern matching.
- Some event parameters are missing, such as `UserBanned`.
- Some events pass excessively redundant parameters, such as `MessageButtonClicked`.

Full changes to the event parameters can be found in the appendix at the end of the document. All usages involving these
events need to be updated accordingly.

All formatting methods in the KMarkdown formatting helper class `Format` have been changed to extension methods, and a
new optional parameter `sanitize` has been added to support whether to escape special characters in the text, which
defaults to true. The calling method of extension methods is still compatible with the original static method calling
method. By default, all formatting methods escape special characters in the text that conflict with KMarkdown syntax to
avoid syntax parsing errors. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled through the `sanitize` parameter. If
the text parameter passed to this method has already escaped special characters, the `sanitize` parameter should be set
to `false`, or the input parameter should be adjusted to the original unescaped text. Additionally, the logic of
the `Format.Quote` and `Format.BlockQuote` methods have been adjusted. They will now insert line breaks and zero-width
joiners (`\u200d`) as needed within the text to maintain the display effect in the KOOK client. The formatting result of
the `Format.BlockQuote` method guarantees that the entire text block will be displayed as one quoted block in the KOOK
client, while the formatting result of the `Format.Quote` method will split the text into multiple quoted blocks based
on empty lines, with the empty lines not included in the quoted blocks.

The `Parse` and `TryParse` methods in the `CardJsonExtension` class have been renamed to `ParseSingle`
and `TryParseSingle` to avoid conflicts with the `ParseMany` and `TryParseMany` methods used to parse multiple cards.
All calls involving these methods need to be updated accordingly.

The `Features` property type in `IGuild` and `IRecommendInfo` was originally `object[]`, and is now implemented as
the `GuildFeatures` type. All calls involving these properties need to be updated accordingly.

The `RestPresence` namespace has been corrected to `Kook.Rest`. All calls involving `RestPresence` need to update the
namespace reference accordingly.

### Added

- Added methods for managing friends and blocked users. For details, see the appendix at the end of the document.
- Added debug display text for the `Cacheable` and `Quote` classes.
- Added `MaxJoinedGuildDataFetchingRetryTimes` and `JoinedGuildDataFetchingRetryDelay` properties to `KookSocketConfig`
  for controlling the number of times and delay between retries for fetching data when joining a server.
- Added `ParseMany` and `TryParseMany` methods to `CardJsonExtension`.
- (Experimental feature) Added the `IVoiceRegion.MinimumBoostLevel` property.
- (Experimental feature) Added `ValidateCardAsync` and `ValidateCardsAsync` methods to `KookRestClient`.

### Changed

- Changed the parameter types for some events in `BaseSocketClient`. For details, see the appendix at the end of the
  document.
- The formatting methods in the `Format` helper class have been changed to extension methods, and a new optional
  sanitize parameter has been added to support escaping special characters in the text. The default value is `true`.

- Fixed an issue where `IGuild.OwnerId` is`0`.
- Fixed an issue where the `IsPinned` property was not set correctly in `BaseSocketClient.Pinned`
  and `BaseSocketClient.Unpinned` events.
- Fixed an issue where the `IPresence.ActiveClient` property could be unintentionally cleared.
- Fixed an issue where the debug display format of `IPresence` was incorrect.
- Fixed an issue where the default implementation of `IRestClient` could throw an exception when `DEBUG_REST`
  preprocessor directive was enabled for debugging high-concurrency requests in the source code.
- Fixed an issue where `Quote.Empty` was not a static property.

### Optimized

- Fixed an issue with missing preprocessor directives in `KookRestApiClient`.
- Optimized the `SocketUser.UpdateIntimacyAsync` method's implementation of the `IUser` interface.
- Improved the use of `NumberBooleanConverter`.
- `KookSocketClient` logs warnings or the content of received packets when they are out of order or not handled
  correctly.
- When printing exception packets, `KookSocketClient` uses the passed-in `serializerOptions` serialization options.
- Completed XML documentation for `BaseSocketClient` events.

### Misc

- Due to the issue of missing field values when creating roles being fixed on the KOOK server side, commit
  1726d5c7c36ead0544784eb937660537c6ec1f4f has been reverted.
