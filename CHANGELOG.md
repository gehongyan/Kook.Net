## v0.5.0 [2023-05-21]

### Update Path

For the sake of convenience, this version has made adjustments to the parameter types passed in some events
in `BaseSocketClient`. Please refer to the appendix at the end of the document for specific changes to event parameters.
Applications involving these events need to be updated accordingly.

The enum values and properties representing key accounts in `GuildFeature` and `GuildFeatures` have been renamed
for more accurate naming. `GuildPermissions` has been refactored as a struct, and the type of
the `RoleProperties.Permissions` property has been changed accordingly. The type of `RestGuild.Channels` was incorrectly
declared as a dictionary with values of type `RestChannel`, and has been corrected to a dictionary with values of
type `RestGuildChannel`. The return type of some methods on `KookSocketClient` was previously `ValueTask`, but has now
been unified to `Task`. Usages involving these APIs need to be updated accordingly.

### Added

- Added `GuildFeature.Partner` enum value and `GuildFeatures.IsPartner` property.
- Added `IGuild.Banner` property.
- Added `CurrentUserNickname`, `CurrentUserDisplayName`, and `CurrentUserRoles` properties on `RestGuild`.

- Added `TextChannels`, `VoiceChannels`, and `CategoryChannels` properties on `RestGuild`.

### Changed
.
- Renamed `GuildFeature.Ka` to `GuildFeature.KeyAccount` and `GuildFeatures.IsKa` to `GuildFeatures.IsKeyAccount`.
- Changed `GuildPermissions` to a struct and changed `RoleProperties.Permissions` to type `GuildPermissions?`.
- For convenience, some events in `BaseSocketClient` have been changed or added with event parameters. See the appendix
  at the end of the document for details..
- Changed all parameters of `DownloadBoostSubscriptionsAsync` method on `BaseSocketClient` to optional parameters.
- Changed the type of `RestGuild.Channels` to `ImmutableDictionary<ulong, RestGuildChannel>`.
- Changed the return type of `GetChannelAsync`, `GetDMChannelAsync`, `GetDMChannelsAsync`, and `GetUserAsync` methods
  on `KookSocketClient` to `Task<*>`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where some APIs were unable to correctly parse the string `1` or `0` when returning a bool type.
- Fixed an issue where `IGuild.DefaultChannelId` was not correctly set to the actual default text channel configured on
  the server.
- Fixed an issue where `SocketGuild.CurrentUser` was null when downloading the server user list.
- Fixed an issue where `IsOnline` and `ActiveClient` on `SocketUser` could throw null reference exceptions.
- Fixed an issue where messages of type `MessageType.Poke` were not correctly parsed.
- Fixed an issue where the request bucket was not handling HTTP 429 Too Many Requests errors correctly.

### Optimized

- Optimized the debugger display text of `Cacheable`.
- `FileAttachment.Stream` can now be reused.
- The `SendFileAsync` and `ReplyFileAsync` methods will now cache the asset URI created for `FileAttachment` attachments
  created through files or streams before multiple sends, to avoid uploading the same file repeatedly.

  `SocketGuildChannel.RolePermissionOverwrites` were not removed when a user left the guild or a role was deleted.

## v0.4.0 [2023-04-03]

### Update Path

Due to the following reasons, this version has made adjustments to the parameter types passed in some events
in `BaseSocketClient`:

- Some parameters are always present and do not need to be wrapped with `Cacheable`, such as `MessageDeleted`
  and `UserConnected`.
- The data sent by the gateway is incomplete, resulting in missing parameters in some events. These event parameters
  have been adjusted to entities wrapped with `Cacheable` to fix the issue of unknown entity IDs that cannot be obtained
  through the REST client API request for complete data.
- The original processing logic for incomplete data sent by the gateway was to obtain complete data by initiating API
  requests through the REST client, which may cause performance issues or timeouts in large servers, such
  as `GuildMemberOnline` and `GuildMemberOffline`. These event parameters have been adjusted to entities wrapped
  with `Cacheable`, and can be obtained on demand through the `GetOrDownloadAsync` method.
- Some event parameters are too specific, resulting in a mismatch of types and passing empty values, such
  as `ReactionAdded`.
- Some event parameters are too general, such as `MessageDeleted` and `UserConnected`, which can avoid unnecessary
  pattern matching.
- Some event parameters are missing, such as `UserBanned`.
- Some events pass excessively redundant parameters, such as `MessageButtonClicked`.

Full changes to the event parameters can be found in the appendix at the end of the document. All usages involving these
events need to be updated accordingly.

All formatting methods in the KMarkdown formatting helper class `Format` have been changed to extension methods, and a
new optional parameter `sanitize` has been added to support whether to escape special characters in the text, which
defaults to true. The calling method of extension methods is still compatible with the original static method calling
method. By default, all formatting methods escape special characters in the text that conflict with KMarkdown syntax to
avoid syntax parsing errors. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled through the `sanitize` parameter. If
the text parameter passed to this method has already escaped special characters, the `sanitize` parameter should be set
to `false`, or the input parameter should be adjusted to the original unescaped text. Additionally, the logic of
the `Format.Quote` and `Format.BlockQuote` methods have been adjusted. They will now insert line breaks and zero-width
joiners (`\u200d`) as needed within the text to maintain the display effect in the KOOK client. The formatting result of
the `Format.BlockQuote` method guarantees that the entire text block will be displayed as one quoted block in the KOOK
client, while the formatting result of the `Format.Quote` method will split the text into multiple quoted blocks based
on empty lines, with the empty lines not included in the quoted blocks.

The `Parse` and `TryParse` methods in the `CardJsonExtension` class have been renamed to `ParseSingle`
and `TryParseSingle` to avoid conflicts with the `ParseMany` and `TryParseMany` methods used to parse multiple cards.
All calls involving these methods need to be updated accordingly.

The `Features` property type in `IGuild` and `IRecommendInfo` was originally `object[]`, and is now implemented as
the `GuildFeatures` type. All calls involving these properties need to be updated accordingly.

The `RestPresence` namespace has been corrected to `Kook.Rest`. All calls involving `RestPresence` need to update the
namespace reference accordingly.

### Added

- Added methods for managing friends and blocked users. For details, see the appendix at the end of the document.
- Added debug display text for the `Cacheable` and `Quote` classes.
- Added `MaxJoinedGuildDataFetchingRetryTimes` and `JoinedGuildDataFetchingRetryDelay` properties to `KookSocketConfig`
  for controlling the number of times and delay between retries for fetching data when joining a server.

- (Experimental feature) Added the `IVoiceRegion.MinimumBoostLevel` property.
- (Experimental feature) Added `ValidateCardAsync` and `ValidateCardsAsync` methods to `KookRestClient`.

### Changed

  and `BaseSocketClient.Unpinned` events.
- Fixed an issue where the `IPresence.ActiveClient` property could be unintentionally cleared.
- Fixed an issue where the debug display format of `IPresence` was incorrect.
- Fixed an issue where the default implementation of `IRestClient` could throw an exception when `DEBUG_REST`
  preprocessor directive was enabled for debugging high-concurrency requests in the source code.

### Optimized

- Fixed an issue with missing preprocessor directives in `KookRestApiClient`.
- Optimized the `SocketUser.UpdateIntimacyAsync` method's implementation of the `IUser` interface.
- Improved the use of `NumberBooleanConverter`.
- `KookSocketClient` logs warnings or the content of received packets when they are out of order or not handled
  correctly.
- When printing exception packets, `KookSocketClient` uses the passed-in `serializerOptions` serialization options.
- Completed XML documentation for `BaseSocketClient` events.

### Misc

- Due to the issue of missing field values when creating roles being fixed on the KOOK server side, commit
  1726d5c7c36ead0544784eb937660537c6ec1f4f has been reverted.
